## Customer Churn Analysis using Machine Learning

This project applies a multifaceted machine learning approach to analyse customer churn in the telecommunications sector. The study combines supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to support business intelligence and data-driven decision making.

### Methods Used
- Logistic Regression for churn classification
- Probability-based churn risk estimation using logistic regression outputs
- K-Means clustering for customer segmentation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key churn drivers

### Key Insights
- Customer tenure and pricing factors strongly influence churn behaviour
- Probability-based modelling supports risk prioritisation
- Clustering reveals distinct customer segments with different churn tendencies

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn

### Dataset
Public telecommunications customer churn dataset sourced from Kaggle.

This project was completed as part of an academic course in machine learning and business intelligence.
